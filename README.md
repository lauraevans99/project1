Elevator Pitch:
	Recent research has proved that the long mysterious skill of perfect pitch can be taught... but only to children under the age of 4.  This makes traditional methods of teaching music (via piano, etc.) very difficult.  I am developing an iPad game that teaches toddlers perfect pitch in a fun and engaging manner.

User Stories:

	Story 1 - 
	Sara and James are new parents. The are well-educated with stable jobs but are a little bit flustered with a young child (under age 4). They both understand the importance of education, specifically early stage learning, and wish to give their child every advantage they can have in life. Sara and James, however, are very busy people (it's not easy caring for a kid and each holding down a job!) and have bought an iPad to let little Johnny play with while they are busy. They feel guilty letting the iPad substitute when they are not available and are looking for apps that not only engage Johnny, but also teach him something very valuable. Sara and James are willing to pay a moderate amount to have their problem solved (teach useful skill to Johnny, mitigate parent guilt, free up parent time, give Johnny leg up in competition for college & life). They have heard on NPR that perfect pitch can be taught to children under age four and are looking for an app that teaches it.

	Story 2 - 
	Johnny is a toddler (3 years old) and his parents are very invested in his education. He is given an iPad with an app that teaches perfect pitch while his parents take phone calls and work. Johnny is engaged by the bright flashing colors and changing sounds/songs. He also figures out that he can earn rainbow points for getting the quiz questions right. Johnny is entertained (and unbeknownst to him, learning a very valuable skill)
